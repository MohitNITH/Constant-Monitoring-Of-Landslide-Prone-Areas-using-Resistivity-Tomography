## Electrical Resistivity Tomography and Landslide Alert System

**Authors**: Mohit Choudhary, Abhishek Duharia

**Abstract**: This project developed a **Multi Electrode Resistivity Meter** using a **low-cost circuit design**[^2^][2]. The instrument utilizes a **boost converter** and **Arduino Mega** for voltage control, and Processing as a GUI

**Objective**: To create an **affordable, Arduino-based resistivity meter** for geophysical exploration, focusing on landslide detection through soil resistivity mapping.

**Solution**: The system employs **electrodes and sensors** to measure soil resistivity, generating a **heatmap** for real-time analysis. This method is **efficient, precise, cost-effective, and versatile**.

**Conclusion**: This approach enhances geotechnical engineering and environmental monitoring, providing detailed insights into soil properties and aiding in **informed decision-making** for infrastructure and environmental projects.
